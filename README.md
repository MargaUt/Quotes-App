# Quotes App

Quotes App is designed to record, save being read or finished reading books and memorable quotes.

## Technologies

To create this program I used these technologies: 
 back end part - Spring Boot on Java 11,
 front end - React with Bootstrap.
I used these technologies mainly because I wanted to consolidate the material and knowledge I had learned.

## Usage

The home page displays the last 3 recorded quotes.
When user is not logged in, he has a possibility to view all saved books listed in a table with all information. 
When user clicks on a book, he can enter single book page along with quotes assigned to the book.
An offline user cannot enter books or quotes, nor can edit existing ones.

## Challenges

Biggest challenge for me was planning. 
Agile user story helped me organize work and understand what is the most important in this app - what less.
